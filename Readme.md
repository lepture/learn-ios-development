# Learn iOS Development

I've tried several times to learn iOS development. I've even written an
article on [Mac App development](http://lepture.com/en/2012/create-a-statusbar-app).
However, I haven't created any Apps. I just dropped every time.

I hope this repository will force me to keep the tune of the learning.
